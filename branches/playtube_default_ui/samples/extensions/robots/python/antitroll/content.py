     I'm developing a sample robot who says hello to a new comer when s/he

     Is there a good api to get a display name from id? Or, should I get a

     Hi, 
     I would like to know if it.s possible, or recommended, to order lat/ 
     lon locations?  I.m planning an application that requires engineer 
     locations to be ordered from south to north.  In this instance the 
     application will deal with locations in Ireland (north and south) that 
     are then divided into operational areas.  Within each area I would 
     like to have engineer locations ordered.  Ideally I.d like to use lat/ 
     lon, however I have considered converting these to Irish Grid

     Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

     I am aware that I may have passed the 2500/15000 limit. Now I

     GoDaddy may be a problem but it was not confirmed. Is their any way of
